1. Introduction to Arduino 
2. Getting Started with Arduino IDE
    * Installation
        * Download the Arduino IDE.
        * Install the Arduino IDE software.
    * Connecting Your Arduino Board
        * Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
        * Install necessary drivers (if required).
    * Opening the Arduino IDE
        * Launch the Arduino software on your computer.
    * Setting Up the Arduino IDE
        * Select the appropriate Arduino board from the "Tools" menu.
        * Choose the correct port your Arduino is connected to from the "Tools" menu.
    * Writing Your First Sketch (Program)
        * Create a new sketch by clicking "File" and then "New."
        * Write your code in the integrated text editor.
        * Verify your code for errors by clicking the checkmark icon ("Verify").
        * Upload your code to the Arduino board by clicking the right arrow ("Upload").
    * Monitoring Serial Output 
        * Open the Serial Monitor to observe output if your code includes serial communication.
